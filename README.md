# GPU-is-a-birthright

# Motivation

Having a GPU is a must when it comes to Deep Learning and
not every one has access to one. 
Having could platforms such as colab is all well and good until one wants to work 
loacally and dosent want to deal with the hassle of moving data around.
This helps us to bridge the gap between google colab and local machines, to train a model on colab without dealing with the hassle of moving data around.
